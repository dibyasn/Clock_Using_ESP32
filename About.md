## Introduction
This repository features two projects that demonstrate how to create real-time clocks using the ESP32 microcontroller. The projects include an analog clock and a digital clock, both utilizing the ESP32's capabilities to connect to WiFi and display the current time.

## Projects

### 1. Analog Clock using ESP32

</p>

This project uses an ESP32 board to connect to WiFi and display the current time on a 0.96" OLED display using I2C communication. The clock synchronizes time over WiFi using NTP (Network Time Protocol) and displays it on the OLED screen with a graphical clock face.

For detailed setup instructions, circuit diagrams, and code explanations, please refer to the [Analog Clock Project README](https://github.com/dibyasn/Clock_Using_ESP32/blob/main/Analog_Clock/Readme.md).

### 2. Digital Clock using ESP32

</p>

This project uses an ESP32 microcontroller to fetch the current time from the internet and display it on an SSD1306 OLED screen. The clock displays the current time, date, and day of the week, with smooth transitions and updates.

For detailed setup instructions, circuit diagrams, and code explanations, please refer to the [Digital Clock Project README](https://github.com/dibyasn/Clock_Using_ESP32/blob/main/Time_Date_Day/Readme.md).

## Getting Started

To get started with either project:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/dibyasn/Clock_Using_ESP32.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
    ```sh
    cd Clock_Using_ESP32/Analog_Clock
    # or for digital clock
    cd Clock_Using_ESP32/Time_Date_Day
    ```

3. **Follow the Setup Instructions** in the respective project's README file.
